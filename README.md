# LoggerBot for Hypixel
A Discord bot to log a player's status on Hypixel and alerts them upon suspicious activity. The goal is to protect and guard your account from being hijacked by notifying you in certain cases. Red alerts activate when a unusual language is used on Hypixel (More to be added), while Orange alerts include different versions of Minecraft, unusual login times, relogs, and short playtimes. See !setup for instructions on setting this bot up. Feel free to copy the code or whatever and make your own changes. Be warned that my code isn't super readable though. Contact Attituding#6517 for any issues regarding anything made or done by me. UPDATE: June 20th, 2020. Progress is happening slowly, and the project may be delayed by a week or two to mid July. Maybe. Also, you won't see any more changed here for now as I am working in a private repository currently.
